# Agent Testing Rules & Guide

This document provides rules and guidance for creating and managing agent test specifications (test spec YAML files) used with the Salesforce CLI `agent test` commands.

---

## Test Specs and AiEvaluationDefinitions

A **test spec** is a local YAML file (in `specs/`) that defines test cases for an agent. It is the human-readable, source-controlled definition of a test.

An **AiEvaluationDefinition** is the Salesforce metadata type that represents a deployed test in the org. It lives in `force-app/main/default/aiEvaluationDefinitions/` after creation.

These are two different artifacts:

| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Test spec (YAML) | `specs/` (local project) | Author and version-control test definitions |
| AiEvaluationDefinition (metadata) | Org + `aiEvaluationDefinitions/` | Execute tests in the org |

A test spec existing locally does **NOT** mean the test exists in the org. You must explicitly create the AiEvaluationDefinition using `sf agent test create` before you can run it with `sf agent test run`.

---

## Test Spec File Format

Test specs are YAML files that define test cases for a specific agent. They are the local, human-readable equivalent of the `AiEvaluationDefinition` metadata component.

### Required Top-Level Fields

```yaml
name: "Human-readable test name"
description: "Description of what this test covers."
subjectType: AGENT
subjectName: Agent_API_Name
testCases:
  - ...
```

- `name`: Human-readable label for the test.
- `description`: Brief summary of the test's purpose.
- `subjectType`: Always `AGENT`.
- `subjectName`: The API name of the agent being tested. Must match the `developer_name` in the agent's `.agent` file.

### Test Case Schema

Each entry in `testCases` uses **camelCase** field names:

```yaml
testCases:
  - utterance: "Natural language input to the agent"
    expectedTopic: topic_api_name
    expectedActions:
      - action_api_name
    expectedOutcome: "Natural language description of the expected result."
    customEvaluations: []
    conversationHistory: []
    metrics:
      - coherence
      - conciseness
      - output_latency_milliseconds
```

#### Required Fields

- `utterance`: The user input to test. Write utterances that reflect realistic user language.
- `expectedTopic`: API name of the topic the agent should route to.
- `expectedActions`: Array of action API names the agent should invoke. Use `[]` if no action is expected (e.g., the agent should ask a clarifying question instead).
- `expectedOutcome`: Natural language description of the expected result. This is evaluated by the testing framework, not matched literally.

#### Optional Fields

- `metrics`: Array of metric names to evaluate. See [Available Metrics](#available-metrics).
- `customEvaluations`: Array of custom evaluation criteria. See [Custom Evaluations](#custom-evaluations).
- `conversationHistory`: Array of prior conversation turns for multi-turn testing. See [Conversation History](#conversation-history).
- `contextVariables`: Array of context variable name/value pairs for Service agents. See [Context Variables](#context-variables).

---

## Available Metrics

Include metrics in the `metrics` array for each test case. Omitting the `metrics` section disables metric evaluation for that test case.

| Metric | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| `coherence` | Response is easy to understand with no grammatical errors |
| `completeness` | Response includes all essential information |
| `conciseness` | Response is brief but comprehensive |
| `output_latency_milliseconds` | Time from request to response |
| `instruction_following` | How well the response follows subagent instructions |
| `factuality` | How factual the response is |

### Metric Selection Guidance

- Always include `output_latency_milliseconds` — latency data is useful for all test cases.
- Include `instruction_following` for test cases that verify guardrails, constraints, or specific behavioral rules (e.g., off-topic rejection, gating logic).
- Include `factuality` when the response must contain verifiably correct data (e.g., from an action output).
- `coherence` and `conciseness` are good defaults for most test cases.
- `completeness` is useful when the response must cover multiple pieces of information.

---

## Conversation History

Use `conversationHistory` to test utterances within the context of a prior conversation. This enables multi-turn test scenarios.

```yaml
testCases:
  - utterance: "Follow-up question"
    expectedTopic: target_topic
    expectedActions:
      - expected_action
    expectedOutcome: "Expected result given the conversation context."
    conversationHistory:
      - role: user
        message: "First user message"
      - role: agent
        message: "Agent's response to first message"
        topic: topic_used_for_response
      - role: user
        message: "Second user message"
      - role: agent
        message: "Agent's response to second message"
        topic: topic_used_for_response
```

- `role`: Either `user` or `agent`.
- `message`: The text of the conversation turn.
- `topic`: Required for `agent` role entries. The subagent the agent used to generate the response.

The `utterance` field is the final user message that the test actually evaluates. The `conversationHistory` provides context leading up to it.

---

## Custom Evaluations

Custom evaluations test agent responses for specific strings or numbers using JSONPath expressions against the generated data from invoked actions.

```yaml
customEvaluations:
  - label: "Human-readable evaluation name"
    name: string_comparison
    parameters:
      - name: operator
        value: equals
        isReference: false
      - name: actual
        value: "$.generatedData.invokedActions[*][?(@.function.name == 'Action_Name')].function.input.inputField"
        isReference: true
      - name: expected
        value: "expected_value"
        isReference: false
```

To construct the JSONPath expression, first run the test without custom evaluations using `sf agent test run --verbose` to see the generated JSON data structure for invoked actions.

---

## Context Variables

For Service agents connected to messaging channels, test context variables by adding a `contextVariables` section:

```yaml
contextVariables:
  - name: ContextVariableApiName
    value: "test value"
```

Context variable API names correspond to field names on the `MessagingSession` standard object.

---

## Workflow

Agent testing follows a strict sequence. Skipping steps will cause failures.

### 1. Author the Test Spec

Create or edit a YAML file in `specs/`. See [Test Spec File Format](#test-spec-file-format) for the schema.

### 2. Create the Test in the Org

```bash
sf agent test create --spec specs/My_Agent-testSpec.yaml --api-name My_Agent_Test
```

This deploys the spec as an `AiEvaluationDefinition` in the target org and retrieves the metadata to your local project. The `--api-name` you choose becomes the identifier for all subsequent `run` commands.

### 3. Run the Test

```bash
sf agent test run --api-name My_Agent_Test
```

This executes the test **that already exists in the org**. If the AiEvaluationDefinition does not exist, the command will fail.

### Important: Create Before Run

- `sf agent test run` requires an AiEvaluationDefinition **in the org**. A local test spec YAML file is not sufficient.
- NEVER assume a test exists in the org. If you did not just create it, verify by checking for `AiEvaluationDefinition` metadata in the `aiEvaluationDefinitions/` subdirectory within your package directory.
- If you update a test spec, you must re-run `sf agent test create` to update the org's AiEvaluationDefinition.

---

## CLI Commands

### Generate a Test Spec Interactively

```bash
sf agent generate test-spec
```

Prompts for agent selection, test case details, and generates the YAML file. By default, the spec is saved to `specs/{Agent_API_Name}-testSpec.yaml`.

### Generate a Test Spec from Existing Metadata

```bash
sf agent generate test-spec \
    --from-definition force-app/main/default/aiEvaluationDefinitions/MyTest.aiEvaluationDefinition-meta.xml \
    --output-file specs/My_Agent-testSpec.yaml
```

### Preview a Test Without Deploying

```bash
sf agent test create --preview \
    --spec specs/My_Agent-testSpec.yaml \
    --api-name My_Agent_Test
```

Generates a local `AiEvaluationDefinition` preview file without updating the org.

### Create a Test in the Org

```bash
sf agent test create \
    --spec specs/My_Agent-testSpec.yaml \
    --api-name My_Agent_Test
```

Creates the test in the org and retrieves the `AiEvaluationDefinition` metadata to your local project.

### Run a Test

```bash
sf agent test run --api-name My_Agent_Test
```

Add `--verbose` to include generated data (invoked actions, inputs, outputs) in the results. Use this data to build JSONPath expressions for custom evaluations.

### View Test Results in the Org

```bash
sf org open --path /lightning/setup/TestingCenter/home
```

---

## File Naming & Location

- Test specs live in the `specs/` directory at the project root.
- Default naming convention: `{Agent_API_Name}-testSpec.yaml`
- The corresponding `AiEvaluationDefinition` metadata is retrieved to the `aiEvaluationDefinitions/` subdirectory within your package directory after `sf agent test create` runs.

---

## Metadata Locations

Metadata source paths depend on the package directories defined in `sfdx-project.json` at the project root. Check the `packageDirectories` array for the correct base path. `force-app` is a common default but is not guaranteed. Metadata type subdirectories (e.g., `aiEvaluationDefinitions/`) are relative to `<packageDirectory>/main/default/`.

---

## Common Mistakes

- **Inventing schema fields**: The test spec schema is fixed. Do not add fields like `type`, `version`, `subject`, `expectations`, or `turns`. Use only the fields documented above.
- **Using snake_case for field names**: Test spec fields are **camelCase** (`expectedTopic`, `expectedActions`, `expectedOutcome`, `conversationHistory`, `customEvaluations`, `testCases`).
- **Omitting `expectedActions`**: Always include this field. Use `[]` when no action is expected.
- **Using `expectedOutcome` as a literal match**: The expected outcome is a natural language description evaluated by the testing framework. Write it as a description of what should happen, not as an exact string to match.
- **Forgetting `topic` on agent conversation history entries**: Every `role: agent` entry in `conversationHistory` must include a `topic` field.
- **Running a test that hasn't been created in the org**: A test spec YAML in `specs/` does NOT mean the test exists in the org. You must run `sf agent test create` before `sf agent test run`. If you skip the create step, the run command will fail.
- **Guessing or constructing the `--api-name` for `sf agent test run`**: The `--api-name` must match an `AiEvaluationDefinition` that has been created in the org. Do not infer this name from the agent name, test spec filename, or task instructions. Verify it exists by checking for metadata in the `aiEvaluationDefinitions/` subdirectory within your package directory, or by confirming you just created it with `sf agent test create`.
